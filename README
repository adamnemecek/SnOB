SnOB - An FFT toolkit for the symmetric group


SnOB is a C++ library for computing fast Fourier transforms and inverse fast 
Fourier transforms on the symmetric group. SnOB uses Clausen's algorithm 
and extensions thereof. For a full description of what SnOB does, see the 
user manual SnOB.ps or SnOB.pdf.
